# 🏡 Guesthouse Reservation Platform

This is a **React-based reservation platform** for a guesthouse or a hotel. Visitors can browse images of the location, view contact information including an embedded map, and send reservation requests via a custom booking form.

The platform includes **two separate admin panels**:
- **Client Admin Panel** – allows the guesthouse owner to view and manage reservation requests.
- **Developer Admin Panel** – provides modular configuration for the entire site, including:
  - Accommodation name
  - Image galleries
  - Contact details
  - Embedded Google Maps iframe
  - Booking configuration options

Everything is designed to be modular and easily configurable through the developer panel, making it adaptable to any type of accommodation business.
